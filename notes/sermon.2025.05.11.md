## Notes
- *The Great Divorce* by C. S. Lewis
    - Guy with the lizard
    - The sufferings of this present time...
### What is the good?
- Verse 28 & 29
    - Conformed to the image of his son
    - 'The good' is being like Jesus
    - God's design is to take our pain and use it like Jesus' suffering on the cross.
### The problem of suffering
- Is Jesus dying on the cross the best or worst thing to ever happen?
- The disciples' perspective
    - Jesus is defeated?
    - Jesus is victorious
- Christianity's view of suffering
    - God enters into our suffering
    - LotR - "Is everything sad going to come untrue?"
### For and against
- How things appear:
    - Seems like many things are against us
    - We are accused of many things
    - Feels like God may not be for us
    - We fail, how can God be for us?
- Why does God move towards us?
    - God loves you because he loves you
    - Deuteronomy 7
    - Christ dies to show his love
    - Independent and unconditional love
- Jesus is our advocate before the Father
    - Jesus is not begging for mercy
    - Jesus has satisfied God's justice through his death on the cross
### Why is there pain?
- God's people always experience suffering
    - Look to Jesus' example
    - Jesus was loved by the Father and had a life of suffering.
- Inseparable
    - Jesus stayed on the cross
    - If he didn't abandon us then, he won't now.
