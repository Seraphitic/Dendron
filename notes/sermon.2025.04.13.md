## Notes
- Have to know Jesus as a King
### The Triumphal Entry
- Parody of a Roman triumphal entry
    - Huge celebration for general
    - "You're just a man"
- Contrast with Jesus
    - No display of wealth and power
    - The only one with a complete claim to the throne.
    - King marked by humility
- What the disciples must be thinking
    - What is going on here?
- Jesus triumphs through his own death
- What happens when you have everything?
    - We tend to get prideful and consumed
    - Jesus comes in and specifically shows his humility
- Jesus comes in humble, but not weak.
