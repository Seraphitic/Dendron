## Notes
- Affluence
    - Money can get you a lot of places
    - Affluence (not just money) helps you get places. Jesus does not promise this
    - Jesus does promise abundance, which means leaving behind
### Power in affluence
- People in that day couldn't (and didn't) hide riches
    - This guy is somebody
- Burning question
    - "What do **I do** to get eternal life?"
    - "What do I still lack?"
        - Can feel that he's still missing something 
- Jesus' response is to list the *second* half of the commandments
    - Pointing out his relationship with God is the problem
- Sad because he has money and power because of his affluence
    - Desire for life right now greater than the desire for eternal life.
- C. S. Lewis in *Mere Christianity*
    - Things in life that make us not feel the need for God
    - We think we're ok because we get by by ourselves.
- What would God ask you to give away that rivals our affection for Him?
### Pride in unaffluence
- Peter asking "What are we going to get?"
    - Different kind of religiosity
- *Field of dreams*
    - What's in it for me
    - Look at what I've given up
- Where do we think Jesus owes us.
    - Likely in the places we've given things up or been 'noble'
### Path of abundance
- Have to leave something behind
    - All the things that we think will get us places
- Jesus left everything behind to save us
