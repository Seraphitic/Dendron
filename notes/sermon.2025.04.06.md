## Notes
- Teddy getting 'the good stuff' from the donut
    - Don't love the guilt we often feel
    - To be human is to feel guilty
### Awareness of guilt
- Jesus and Peter last crossed paths at the Last Supper 
    - Peter says that he won't leave Jesus
    - Peter then **does** deny Jesus and weeps about it.
- What is guilt?
    - Different to shame (mistake is **who we are**)
    - Failing to reach the bar of where we should be
- Guilt seeps into our emotions.
    - Bitterly (only time used in the Bible) → resentful and condemnable
    - We don't like feeling guilty in our gut
    - When we most keenly feel our guilt, we put up some kind of armor to shield ourselves.
- What do we do when we feel most aware of our guilt?
### Jesus addresses our guilt
- Jesus has the ability to lay it on Peter
    - Jesus instead deals with it honestly and redemptively
- Jesus rewrites the story
    - Morning, fire, three questions
- "Do you love me?"
    - Peter has no way to plead his own case
        - Can't point to anything he's done
    - Peter has to fall on Jesus' knowledge of Peter
- What is the story that needs to be addressed in our life?
### Freedom from our guilt
- Guilt also creeps back into our life
    - Part of how we're wired 
- Peter's story
    - Fisherman → Disciple → Guilt-ridden (back to fishing) → Called
- Ephesians 2:8-10
    - Hard to believe the first part, so impossible to believe the second part
    - Jesus' mercy and what he's done **does** cover what we've done.
