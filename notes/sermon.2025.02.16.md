## Notes
### Jesus sees
- Jesus sees the woman and enters into her sorrow.
    - He has compassion on her.
    - He doesn't just let her pass by.
- Not alone anymore
    - Jesus gets down in the muck with us; allows us to feel seen.
- Inspiring us to see those around us too.
    - Making sure that we have open eyes for the sorrowful
### Jesus restores
- Jesus acts and speaks to the woman
    - Jesus knows that she has hope
- Jesus restores because he has authority
    - Authority over death
- Jesus restores the life of this widow
    - There is nobody to provide for this widow
    - By bringing back the son, Jesus gives the widow hope and life
- Plane crash 
    - We can't restore people
    - We **can** point people to the one who can restore
    - Look to Jesus to help restore
        - Job and his friends
### Jesus heals
- A great prophet
    - Prophet Elijah raises a widow's son
    - Parallels, but shows that he's a greater one than Elijah
- Jesus shows that God has come to stay
- Jesus gave the widow something else to define her life
    - Jesus enters into the sorrow
    - Doesn't erase the sorrow now, but does join us.
    - Jesus points to the day when things are fully restored

    - He was going to be an only son who would die
    - Jesus knew that he also would be raised to give life and hope
