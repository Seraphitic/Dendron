## Notes
- Randy Newman
    - I love LA → itemizing his love of LA
    - Paul is itemizing his love of love
- The Corinthian church is messed up
    - Paul has itemized their problems
    - He's trying to calibrate them with love
- Why is this a greatest hit?
    - We realize that this isn't real life, but it should be
- Our greatest problem is lovelessness, and the greatest gift is Jesus' love for us.
### The true danger of lovelessness
- Corinth was an 'it' city
    - The people are confused
- Problems center on lovelessness
    - Selfishness
    - Pride
    - Hurting self and others
- Lack of love
    - Paul makes the point that all of their gifts, faith, and sacrifice mean nothing without love
    - The biggest danger to the church is lovelessness.
    - When our gifts are more than our need of grace, then we are in trouble.
- Evangelical epoxy
    - Gifts + lovelessness = hardness of heart
    - Supposed to point us back to the source of love
    - Should use our gifts, but more important for our hearts to be right
### The traits of true love
- 'Agape' → a different kind of love
    - A love for the unworthy; proceeds from the nature of the lover
- "Love is..."
    - Patient
    - Kind → bless others
    - Not envious → want good things for others
    - Not boastful
    - Not arrogant
    - Not rude
    - Not insistent on it's own way
    - Not irritable
    - Not resentful → doesn't keep score
    - Not joyful at wrongdoing
    - Joyful in the truth
    - Strong
    - Trusting
    - Hopeful
    - Enduring
    - Unending
- Present-continuous tense → all of this should happen all the time
    - We're terrible at this
    - Love is not efficient, but it is effective
- Why can't we be and do these things
    - Fear & pride
    - How do fear and pride show up in our life?
### The true source of love
- If you aren't near the lover, the people near you will get your fear
    - We love because he first loved us
    - The way we love others is a good indication of how we believe we've been loved
- Put Jesus in the passage
