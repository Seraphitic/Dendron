## Notes
- Good Will Hunting
    - Matt Damon's character criticizes Robin Williams' character's painting
    - Wants to know about **you**. Not academic knowledge, but relational knowledge.
- People drop in uninvited
    - The who of this woman dropping in is the issue
### Healthy shame
- There is a dependency in all of us
    - The woman knows her need and opens herself up to Jesus' help and work.
        - She is a sinner and people knew her reputation.
    - It is human to know that we are in need.
- Acts of healthy shame:
    - Driven to Jesus through risky acts
        - Hair was cultural
        - Perfume was financial safeguard
        - Emotionally risky behavior
### Toxic shame
- Who I am (my need) is not ok
    - Cannot be vulnerable
    - Nothing risked by the Pharisee
    - Spiritual superiority
- Acts of toxic shame
    - Puts on mask and hides
    - Discounting of others
    - Judges others
- What does toxic shame look like for us? 
    - Trying to take higher ground or holding others to toxic standards
### Acceptance of the shamed
- Simon vs this woman
    - Jesus accepts the woman and her faith
        - Ruins the economy of this Pharisee
    - Jesus tells a story
    - Can't clean you up if you're closed to Jesus
- Dishes
    - Let the dishwasher do the job of the dishwasher
    - Woman comes to Jesus to be cleaned correctly
    - Simon tries to clean himself before he'll let Jesus see him.
- Jesus' reactions to both
    - Jesus cleans woman and accepts
    - Jesus converses with Pharisee to help them understand
### Antidote to shame
- The Soul of Shame
    - Vulnerability is the antidote 
    - Simon opposes being vulnerable
    - The woman is the most vulnerable
- True vulnerability is looking to Jesus with our need in mind.
    - The hall of faith â†’ throwing off shame of sin that is hindering us
