series: Conversations

## Notes
- Jesus moving toward people who need healing and gentleness.
    - Different now; dealing with Pharisees
    - Look inward, not outward
    - Callousness of Pharisees (killing) vs. Caring of Jesus (meeting needs)
### Road to callousness
- Who we're the Pharisees?
    - Religious gatekeepers; they knew all of the Law and OT
    - 'Built out' the law to granular level
    - Lost the meaning when trying to obey the law perfectly
- What does the road to callousness look like?
    - **Offendable**; very offended by Jesus and his disciples
    - **Entrapping**; try to catch Jesus in a moral bind
    - **Killing**; plotting how to get rid of Jesus (even with their enemies)
- Calloused hearts will justify things you might think you'd never do.
- Ad Astra
    - Committed to finding aliens while ignoring son
    - Missing the forest for the trees.
    - Pharisees missing Jesus while trying to keep the smallest 'law'
- Fear and pride put us on the road
### Response to callousness
- Jesus shows that he's there to meet the needs of those around him
    - Words → Jesus explains to them who he is
    - Actions → Jesus heals the man with the withered hand
- Shows the Pharisees that he cares more about caring and meeting needs than their rules
    - This makes the Pharisees more hard-hearted
    - Jesus is not meeting needs in the way Pharisees want
    - Jeremiah 17:6 → Pharisees so blind that they can't enjoy the good things of God as they happen in front of them
- Guitar story
    - I don't want what I need; I want what I want.
    - God has the good gift for us, but we often want something else from Him
- What do we do with a calloused heart?
    - Jesus is gracious towards Pharisees
        - Doesn't get offended or demand explanations of them
    - The remedy of callousness is repentance
        - Not more morality
        - Not just not doing something
        - Turning from ourselves and facing God
