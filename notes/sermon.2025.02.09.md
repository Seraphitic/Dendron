## Notes
- 'Love story' → "Have a great life"
    - What is hope? 
        - Not wishful thinking; it's a confident thing.
        - Because God is good, there are good things in store for us (though we may not understand them as such)
### Hostage to hopelessness
- John tells us the purpose of his gospel: that we might believe
    - We are hope shaped creature; how we live is shaped by what we believe about our future.
- The situation:
    - Bethesda → house of mercy
    - Man is there for 38 years
    - Past, present, and future are marked with no assurance of things getting better
    - It hurts to much to hope
- Shawshank Redemption
    - Playing music in the prison to give hope
    - Red believes that hope is too costly in the prison
- Where is there hopelessness that seems too much in our past, present, or future.
### Healing hope
- Do you want to be well?
    - Jesus is almost awkward about this
    - Makes the man think about what he wants
- Get up
    - He's the God with power to make things happen with just a word.
- Sin no more
    - Almost sounds like a threat
    - Already got what he wanted, but has to fix his eyes on what is truly important in his life
    - Jesus is healing his legs to get to his heart 
        - His life is dependent on Jesus' power
- Where is a place that need to build our dependence on Jesus'
### How do we hope?
- The man can't get to the pool to get better
    - Jesus closes the gap between us and Jesus
- Answer the question of, "Do you want to be healed?"
    - Makes you a person of hope.
- Romans 5:1-5
    - Paul says that, because we know Jesus, we will encounter suffering
    - Our suffering will eventually produce hope.
