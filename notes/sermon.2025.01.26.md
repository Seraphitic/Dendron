## Notes
- What is curiosity?
	- What I'm seeing I can't make sense of and I need to speak to the architect. 
- ### The birth of curiosity
	- The lead up to John 3
		- Jesus' miracles
		- Jesus flipping tables
		- Jesus talking about the destruction of the temple
	- Nicodemus is a theologically trained leader in the temple
		- He can't make sense of the signs Jesus is showing
	- Where are the signs in your life that you don't understand? 
		- Go to the architect
- ### The clarity from curiosity
	- Jesus speaks clearly to Nicodemus
		- Jesus is telling him clearly who Jesus is
	- > Hello my name is Inigo Montoya…
		- This is who I am, and what I've come to do
		- Jesus lets Nicodemus know that he is the Son and he's come to save and die.
	- Jesus is speaking kindly and clearly
	- Likely to have more questions
		- The clarity that Jesus gives is himself
	- Who do you think you are? 
		- Jesus wants us to be clear on who we are
- ### The conviction from curiosity
	- "Born again…" to a Pharisee
		- Doesn't mean being more moral and religious.
		- A wind that plants you somewhere else. 
		- Restart and reorient.
	- Rebuild life around Jesus
		- Change will happen
	- We didn't have anything to do with our own birth
	- Born again it's not a strategy, it is a surgery
